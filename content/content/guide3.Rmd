This week we'll talk about risk premiums and examine demand for health insurance (i.e., willingness to pay for health insurance).

### Objectives for this week

- Calculate risk premium and willingness-to-pay for health insurance
- Discuss viability of high-risk pools
 
### Activities
- In-class problem on the demand for health insurance. The worksheet is [here](/resource/wksheet2.html).
